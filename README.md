# Installation
## Find the ssh password (**write it down and keep it safe**)  

in the newest version:
    Settings->Help->Copyright and Licenses (under GPLv3 Compliance)
versions < 2.3:
    Settings->About->Copyright->General Information


**It is really important to have the password somewhere, in case something goes wrong**

## Finding the tablet IP

Bellow the password they will list the avialable IP, get yours and save it for the next comands.



## Linux
You got this

## Windows 10
open a command line prompt (Win-R, type cmd, enter)
ssh root@your.ip.address(type the password)
or install Putty and enter your ip  as address and root for username
paste the automagic line

## macOS
open Spotlight (Cmd-Space) type Terminal, enter
ssh root@your.ip.address (type the password)
paste the automagic line

# Automagic

**Make sure the device has Internet connectivity i.e. Wifi is ON and connected**

Paste the following and press enter:
```
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddvk/remarkable-hacks/master/patch.sh -O-)" 
```
to try a different patch:

```
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddvk/remarkable-hacks/master/patch.sh -O-)" _ patch_xxx 
```
where xxx is the patch number

The app should start, play with it, but press **CTRL-C** (Hold the Control key and press C) to stop it when done **DON'T LEAVE IT JUST RUNNING** and follow the instructions after pressing **CTRL-C**

**Should Press 'Y' and then Enter when asked to make it permanent**

# Notes
patches are cumulative (the last one contains all previous changes and gets updated with bugfixes)
a patch can be applied more than once, it's more of a snapshot really, you can go back to a previous version

## Installation with oxide or draft
The installation starts an instance of xochitl, but isn't aware of oxide or draft running, 
which needs xochitl to be started in a different way. 
Execute this before the installation if you've got oxide or draft running:
```shell
systemctl stop tarnish # only if you're using oxide
systemctl stop draft # only if you're using draft
```
And this after the installation:
```shell
systemctl stop xochitl
systemctl start tarnish # only if you're using oxide
systemctl start draft # only if you're using draft
```
If you forget to do this, you'll have two xochitls running and will see lines double.


## Timezones
The time is in UTC. In order to have the right time, the right timezone should be set (which has things like Daylight Saving Time, utc offsets etc).

Check the list of timezones in [Timezones](docs/timezones.md)  
To set a timezone, run this on the device, by setting one that matches your location e.g.  
`timedatectl set-timezone "Europe/Paris"` or  
`timedatectl set-timezone "America/Denver"`

The device doesn't have all possible timezones. If yours is missing from the list, find a linux distro and copy the missing time zone to `/usr/share/zoneinfo/` then execute the above command with the new zone.

## Extra fonts (e.g Japanese)
The rootfs doesn't have enough space, so you can do this (copy paste in the rm terminal)  
```
mv /usr/share/fonts/ttf ~/ttf
ln -sf /home/root/ttf /usr/share/fonts/ttf
wget https://github.com/tony/dot-fonts/raw/master/Hanazono/HanaMinA.ttf -O ~/ttf/HanaMinaA.ttf
wget https://github.com/tony/dot-fonts/raw/master/Hanazono/HanaMinB.ttf -O ~/ttf/HanaMinaB.ttf
```
for japanese: HanaMinA.ttf and HanaMinB.ttf seem ok  
put new fonts in `/home/root/ttf`,  do `fc-cache` and restart xochitl


## Making it permanent
You should have typed 'Y' when asked

## Revert in case things go terribly wrong
ssh
```
systemctl stop xochitl
rm -fr .cache/remarkable/xochitl/qmlcache/*
cp /home/rmhacks/xochitl.version /usr/bin/xochitl #where version is the current device version
systemctl start xochitl
```

## FAQ

#### How do you make the patches?
I wrote some tools, I change the code, I patch

#### Why is this not open source?
I don't own the source, the legality is dubious, not in reMarkable AS's best interest due to various reasons, etc

#### Can you add this or that feature?
Some things are hard, very time consuming or even impossible for my skill level. I prefer to take a more pragmatic approach and add things that are easy, but from which most users can benefit.

#### What happens when a new offical version comes out? 
You lose the hacks when the device auto updates (If you want to prevent this disable auto updates). When the patches have been ported, you can install them again (bookmarks stay on the device and will reappear)
